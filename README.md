# Experiments with Visualization Libraries in Python

Python has a number of visualization libraries. My goals are the following:

Learn/Experiment with the different visualization libraries
Understand strengths and weaknesses of these libraries
Test them out on different datasets/problems
Some of the visualization libraries I am considering are:

Seaborn
Bokeh
Mayavi
Holoviews
Datashader
Altair
Matplotlib - specific focus on 3-D
